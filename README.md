## User Story
```
As a user, I want to be able to view create and track daily workouts. I want to be able to log multiple exercises in a workout on a given day. I should also be able to track the name, type, weight, sets, reps, and duration of exercise. If the exercise is a cardio exercise, I should be able to track my distance traveled.
```

## Acceptance Criteria
```
When the user loads the page, they should be given the option to create a new workout or continue with their last workout.

The user should be able to:
  - Add exercises to a previous workout plan.
  - Add new exercises to a new workout plan.
  - View the combined weight of multiple exercises on the `stats` page.
```

## Future Development
- Allow a user to edit or remove workouts for a specific day
- Beautify the UI
